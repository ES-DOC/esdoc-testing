Use py-esdoc to create & publish a ResponsibleParty
1. Create and publish a valid person and an organization
    a. Create a valid person and organization in py-esdoc -- OK
    b. Validate using esdoc shell -- OK
    c. Publish using esdoc shell -- OK
    d. See both records in the Viewer
2. Verify CIM validator
    a. Create an invalid person and organization in py-esdoc -- OK
    b. See validator fail -- OK
    c. Verify publish command wonâ€™t work with invalid CIM document
3. Verify unpublishing
    a. Do step #1
    b. Unpublish using esdoc shell
    c. Verify records no longer appear in Viewer
    d. Republish (step #1 again)
4. Verify basic CIM versioning ability
    a. Do step #1 -- OK
    b. Update person and organization details -- OK
    c. Publish updated records -- OK
    d. Observe both sets of records appear in Viewer, and that the more recent one looks to be default

Testing notes:
1. Create and publish a valid person and an organization
- defining a CIM property that doesn't exist isn't an error but it doesn't take
- esdoc-pyesdoc-validate accepts multiple files but only uses the first one
- from the validator error it's not clear which attribute is the problem or what's the problem 
- organisation vs organization

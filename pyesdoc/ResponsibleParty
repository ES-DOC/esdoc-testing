Use py-esdoc to create & publish a ResponsibleParty
1. Create and publish a valid person and an organization
    a. Create valid person and organization CIM documents in py-esdoc -- OK
       rm /esdoc/testing/valid/*
       ./create_valid_responsible_party.py
    b. Validate documents using esdoc shell -- OK
       esdoc-pyesdoc-validate <file>
       Comment: appears to accept more than one input file but only uses the first one
    c. Archive documents -- OK
       source $ESDOC_HOME/bash/init.sh; activate_venv pyesdoc
       rm $ESDOC_HOME/repos/esdoc-archive/esdoc/beta-test/pyesdoc/*
       python $ESDOC_HOME/bash/cmip6/archive_documents.py --source-dir=/esdoc/testing/valid --target-dir=$ESDOC_HOME/repos/esdoc-archive/esdoc/beta-test/pyesdoc/
    c. Publish using esdoc shell -- OK
       Have to manually change "version" in the archived json files to 1. Don't know how to do this properly.
       esdoc-api-db-reset
       esdoc-api-db-ingest
    d. See both records in the database
       psql -U esdoc_db_user esdoc_api
       select * from docs.tbl_document;
    d. See both records through the web API service
       
2. Verify CIM validator
    a. Create an invalid person and organization in py-esdoc -- OK
    b. See validator fail -- OK
    c. Verify publish command wonâ€™t work with invalid CIM document
3. Verify unpublishing
    a. Do step #1
    b. Unpublish using esdoc shell
    c. Verify records no longer appear in Viewer
    d. Republish (step #1 again)
4. Verify basic CIM versioning ability
    a. Do step #1 -- OK
    b. Update person and organization details -- OK
    c. Publish updated records -- OK
    d. Observe both sets of records appear in Viewer, and that the more recent one looks to be default

Testing notes:
1. Create and publish a valid person and an organization
- defining a CIM property that doesn't exist isn't an error but it doesn't take
- esdoc-pyesdoc-validate accepts multiple files but only uses the first one
- from the validator error it's not clear which attribute is the problem or what's the problem 
- organisation vs organization

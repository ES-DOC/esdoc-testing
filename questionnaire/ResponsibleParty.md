## Use the Questionnaire to create & publish a ResponsibleParty
These tests use [cim2.questionnaire.es-doc.org](http://cim2.questionnaire.es-doc.org) and assume there's an existing CMIP6 project that you are a member of. If there's an existing CMIP6 project but you're not a member of it, go to the project, click "Join project", and have Allyn accept the request.

1. Create a Party customization
2. Create a Party document
3. Modify the document
4. Publish
5. Republish
6. See both document versions available through web API, and that the later version is the default

**Can't yet see the documents through the web API, but looks like it will work based on the XML feed**
